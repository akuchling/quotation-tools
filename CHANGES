Version 0.0.5:

	* Converted the DTD into RELAX NG, a more powerful and flexible
          schema language.  (See www.relaxng.org for more info.)
          Future QEL development will only use RELAX NG; the DTD
          will no longer be worked on.

        * Added an optional header to QEL files, with 'title', 'author',
	  'description', 'copyright', and 'license' elements.

	* Added 'type' attribute to quotation, author, and source elements.

	* Added 'rdf:resource' attributes to author and source elements.

        * Rewrote qel.parse to use a pull-style parser (pulldom)
	  instead of SAX.

	* Added support for RST as an output format to the Quotation class
          and to qtformat.


Version 0.0.4:

	* Put the code under the GPL, and put the DTD under the
	  W3C's software license.

	* Began working on a GUI editor (the editor/ directory)

	* Fixed a bug in qtformat's -c option

	* Straightened out the handling of encoding the output as Latin-1

	* Required the use of Expat as the parser

        * Changed the public identifier to use amk.ca as the domain name
	  instead of python.org.  As a result the version number of the DTD
	  was bumped to 2.01.  Nothing else in the DTD was changed.


Version 0.0.3:

	* Implemented the QELdb class, which acts as a fast cache for a
	  (potentially large) QEL file.

        * Fixed bugs in dealing with the <pre/> element.

	* Added -c option to qtgrep, to cause it to just print the number
          of matching quotations for each file searched.

	* Added docstrings so pydoc can produce some helpful output.

        * Added XML output format to qtformat; this now pretty-prints QEL.

	* As part of the previous change, excess whitespace is now
          removed by the XML parser in more places.

	* Removed most uses of isinstance() by using is_break(),
	  is_plain(), and is_preformatted() predicates instead.

	* Added a test suite for the simplify() internal function, which is
          tricky to get right.


Version 0.0.2:

        * Fixed bugs in dealing with the <br/> element.

	* Added a CSS1 stylesheet, xml/qel.css, for formatting QEL.

	* Added a missing trailing newline to quotation-tools.cat

	* New scripts: qtmerge for merging several QEL files into one,
	  and fortune2qel to convert fortune's files into QEL.


Version 0.0.1:

	* Initial release
