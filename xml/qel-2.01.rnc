# This is the Quotation Exchange Language, version 2.01, dated May 4
# 2001.  
# More information on this format is available at:
#      http://www.amk.ca/qel/
# The namespace URI for QEL is "http://www.amk.ca/qel/".
#
# Attributes which take date/time values should encode the value
# according to the W3C NOTE on date/time formats:
#
#        http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime
#
# This RELAX NG schema is a direct translation of the original DTD, 
# and therefore should express exactly the same set of valid documents.

# Include the IBTWSH grammar.
#
# IBTWSH stands for the Itsy-Bitsy Teeny-Weeny Simple Hypertext DTD;
# it's a small and simple subset of HTML.  For QEL, the HTML subset
# needed is still smaller, because there's no need to include images or
# hyperlinks or headers in a quotation.  The supported elements are
# therefore reduced by redefining some of the grammar symbols,
# overriding IBTWSH's definitions.

include "ibtwsh6.rnc" {
    # Override the start element
    start = element quotations { quotation*  }

    # Reduce the number of HTMLish elements available from QEL 
    vert = element p {horiz.model}
    horiz = br | horiz.other
    horiz.other =	element abbr | acronym | cite | code |
			em | foreign | q | pre {horiz.model}
}

# Add the <foreign> element.
# <code>foreign</code> is used for marking words in a
# different language from the language of the rest of the quotation.
# Usually this is rendered typographically by setting the foreign words
# in italics, as in "English has become the <i>lingua franca</i> of
# science."  

foreign = element foreign { basic, horiz.model }


quotation = element quotation { # The 'id' attribute comes from IBTWSH's 'all'

                                author?, source?, note?
