quotation-tools
===============

This is a Python package and associated tools for parsing and
maintaining quotation collections using the Quotation Exchange
Language, or QEL, format.  The scripts making up the toolkit are:

qtformat	For converting QEL to various other formats (text,HTML,Fortune)
qtgrep		For searching through a collection
qtmerge		For merging a number of QEL files 
fortune2qel     Reads a fortune(6) file and outputs QEL for as many quotations
                as possible.

The QEL home page is http://www.amk.ca/qel/ ; the latest version of
this software is available there.


Requirements
============

You will need Python 2.0 or greater.  The Quixote unittest.py is
required to run the test suite, in case you want to hack on the
software; it can be downloaded as part of the Quixote distribution
from http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/python/quixote/ .

The GUI quotation editor in the editor/ subdirectory requires Tkinter
and Pmw (http://pmw.sourceforge.net) to run.

The QEL DTD is under a modified version of the W3C's software license,
though the copyright is held by A.M. Kuchling.


Installation
============

The quotation-tools use the Distutils for installation.  Run:

	python setup.py install

to build and install them.  

The QEL 2.0 DTD and some additional XML declaration files required by
the DTD are installed into /usr/lib/sgml/.  Run 'install-catalog
--install quotation-tools' to add the installed DTDs to the master
catalog.  (On Debian, use 'install-sgmlcatalog' as the script name
instead.)

Suggestions, bug reports, and patches are welcome; please e-mail them
to me at amk@amk.ca.
